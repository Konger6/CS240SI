Given the new solution incorporating error handling and capacity checks in a warehouse management system, let's update the assignment instructions to reflect these enhancements.

Introduction to the Assignment

In this exercise, you'll delve deeper into managing binary files in C, focusing on efficient data processing and storage. You'll work with structured data to simulate real-world scenarios, such as managing inventory in a warehouse. This task will introduce error handling and capacity management, essential for developing robust applications.

Learning Objectives

Understand and manipulate structures in C.
Perform binary file I/O operations using fread() and fwrite().
Implement error handling to manage data integrity and constraints.
Apply file manipulation techniques to ensure data does not exceed predefined limits.
Task Overview

You will develop a program to manage a warehouse's inventory, represented by item structures. This program will include functionalities to add items while checking for duplicate IDs and ensuring the warehouse does not exceed its capacity.

Step-by-Step Instructions

Setup the Development Environment

Ensure a C compiler (e.g., GCC) is installed and functional.
Create a new file named warehouse.c for your code.
Define the item_t Structure and WarehouseErrorCode Enumeration

At the top of your warehouse.c file, define the item_t structure with fields for an item's ID, name, and price.
Define the WarehouseErrorCode enumeration to represent possible error states, including SUCCESS, ERROR_DUPLICATE_ID, ERROR_CAPACITY, and ERROR_FILE.
Implement Utility Functions

Read Function: Create item_t read_item(FILE* file, int index) to read an item from the binary file at a specified index.
Write Function: Create void write_item(FILE* file, item_t item, int index) to write an item to the file at a specific index.
Display Function: Create void display_item(item_t item) to print an item's details to the console.
Existence Check: Implement int item_exists(FILE* file, int id) to check if an item with a given ID already exists in the file.
Add Item: Implement int add_item_to_warehouse(FILE* file, item_t newItem) to add an item to the warehouse, including checks for duplicate IDs and capacity constraints.
Main Function Logic

Open warehouse.bin in read and write mode ("wb+").
Demonstrate adding a few item_t instances to the file, handling potential errors for duplicate IDs or capacity issues.
Read back and display the items to verify the integrity of the warehouse data.
Compile and Test Your Program

Compile your program using GCC or another C compiler with the following command: gcc warehouse.c -o warehouse -Wall -std=c99.
Execute your program and ensure it correctly manages the warehouse inventory, adhering to the specified constraints and error handling.
Additional Notes

Incorporate assertions (assert()) where appropriate to validate assumptions. For example, assert the file handle is not NULL after attempting to open the file.
Consider the defined MAX_WAREHOUSE_SIZE when adding items to ensure the warehouse does not exceed its physical capacity.
