void swap (int *a, int *b); // function prototype

/* Task 1: Write a function named 'swap' that takes two pointers to integers as parameters
   and swaps the values of the integers they point to. */


/* Inside Main Method
  Create a main method, and create an example usage of the swap fcn
  and the correct output */

/* Task 2: Understand pointer dereferencing.  Inside Main Method
   - Create a pointer 'p' and assign it the address of an integer variable 'x' that has a specific value.
   - Print the value of 'x' by dereferencing 'p'.
   - Write what the output would be */


/* Task 3: Explore the relationship between arrays and pointers. Inside Main Method
   - Create an integer array and a pointer.
   - Assign the address of the first element of the array to the pointer.
   - Use the pointer to traverse the array and print each element.
   - Write the expected output
